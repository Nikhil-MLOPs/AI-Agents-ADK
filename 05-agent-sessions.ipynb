    "#### 2.1 The Problem\n",
    "At their core, Large Language Models are inherently stateless. Their awareness is confined to the information you provide in a single API call. This means an agent without proper context management will react to the current prompt without considering any previous history.\n",
    "\n",
    "❓ Why does this matter? Imagine trying to have a meaningful conversation with someone who forgets everything you've said after each sentence. That's the challenge we face with raw LLMs!\n",
    "\n",
    "In ADK, we use Sessions for short term memory management and Memory for long term memory. In the next notebook, you'll focus on Memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 What is a Session?\n",
    "📦 Session\n",
    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a single, continuous conversation. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ADK, a Session is comprised of two key components Events and State:\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 Session.Events:\n",
    "\n",
    "While a session is a container for conversations, Events are the building blocks of a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Events:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "Agent Response: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "Tool Call: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "Tool Output: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning\n",
    "{} Session.State:\n",
    "\n",
    "session.state is the Agent's scratchpad, where it stores and updates dynamic details needed during the conversation. Think of it as a global {key, value} pair storage which is available to all subagents and tools."

      "\n",
      "*   **Uncovering Novel Biological Targets:** AI algorithms can analyze vast datasets of genomic, proteomic, and clinical information to identify previously unknown biological targets that are implicated in diseases. This goes beyond traditional, well-understood pathways.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models can assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can be designed to interact with it effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. De Novo Drug Design and Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Generating Novel Molecules:** Instead of screening existing compound libraries, generative AI models (like Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, and Variational Autoencoders - VAEs) can design entirely new molecules with desired properties from scratch. This is a paradigm shift.\n",
      "*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** Once an initial promising molecule (a \"lead compound\") is found, AI can rapidly iterate and suggest modifications to improve its potency, selectivity, solubility, and pharmacokinetic properties (how the body processes the drug).\n",
      "\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which was:\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. De Novo Drug Design and Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a particularly exciting area because it represents a fundamental shift in how we approach creating new medicines.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is \"De Novo\" Drug Design?**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De Novo\" is Latin for \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\" In the context of drug discovery, de novo drug design refers to the process of **creating entirely novel molecular structures that are specifically designed to interact with a particular biological target and exhibit desired therapeutic properties.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, drug discovery often involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Screening vast libraries** of existing chemical compounds to see if any of them showed activity against a target.\n",
      "*   **Modifying existing drugs** or known active molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "De novo design, empowered by AI, bypasses much of this trial-and-error by *generating* potential drug candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI Enables De Novo Drug Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly **generative AI models**, are the driving force behind this development. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Learning the Rules of Chemistry and Biology:** AI models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules, their chemical properties, and their biological activities. They learn the complex relationships between molecular structure and function, essentially learning the \"language\" of chemistry and how molecules interact with biological systems.\n",
      "*   **Generative Models:** These AI models can then *generate* new data points – in this case, new molecular structures. Common types of generative models used include:\n",
      "    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) that compete. The generator tries to create realistic molecules, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated molecules. This competition drives the generator to produce increasingly novel and valid structures.\n",
      "    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of existing molecules and can then sample from this space to generate new, similar molecules.\n",
      "    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** In some approaches, reinforcement learning can be used to guide the generation process. The AI is \"rewarded\" for creating molecules that meet specific criteria (e.g., high binding affinity to a target, good solubility).\n",
      "*   **Defining Objectives and Constraints:** Researchers provide the AI with specific objectives, such as:\n",
      "    *   **Target binding affinity:** How strongly the molecule will bind to the disease-causing protein.\n",
      "    *   **Selectivity:** Ensuring the molecule binds only to the intended target and not others (to minimize side effects).\n",
      "    *   **Pharmacokinetic properties (ADME):** How the drug will be Absorbed, Distributed, Metabolized, and Excreted by the body.\n",
      "    *   **Physicochemical properties:** Solubility, stability, etc.\n",
      "*   **Iterative Design and Optimization:** The AI can generate thousands or even millions of candidate molecules. These candidates are then filtered and ranked based on their predicted properties. Promising molecules can be fed back into the AI for further refinement and optimization, creating a rapid, iterative design cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits of De Novo AI Drug Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** It can create completely new chemical entities that might not have been conceived by human chemists, potentially leading to breakthrough therapies.\n",
      "*   **Speed:** It can drastically accelerate the early stages of drug discovery, moving from target identification to candidate generation in a fraction of the time.\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** By generating molecules with a higher probability of success, it can reduce the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and tested experimentally.\n",
      "*   **Tackling Difficult Targets:** It offers a powerful approach for designing drugs against challenging biological targets that have been historically difficult to drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples in Action:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Designing Inhibitors for Resistance Mutations:** AI can design molecules that are effective against mutated proteins that have become resistant to existing drugs.\n",
      "*   **Creating Allosteric Modulators:** AI can be used to design molecules that bind to a different site on a protein (an allosteric site) to alter its activity, a more complex task than designing direct inhibitors.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Drug Design:** In the future, AI could potentially design drugs tailored to an individual's specific genetic makeup or disease profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI-powered de novo drug design is like having a highly intelligent, super-fast molecular architect that can build custom-designed molecules from the ground up, specifically engineered to combat disease.\n",

    "You just found the proof! The presence of that special summary Event in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap what you just witnessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Silent Operation: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "Background Compaction: Because you configured the App with EventsCompactionConfig, the ADK Runner automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",
    "Verified Result: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n",
    "For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history. This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n",
    "👉 Custom Compaction\n",
    "In this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom SlidingWindowCompactor and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Context Caching\n",
    "ADK also provides Context Caching to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data. Read more about it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem\n",
    "While we can do Context Compaction and use a database to resume a session, we face new challenges now. In some cases, we have key information or preferences that we want to share across other sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these scenarios, instead of sharing the entire session history, transferring information from a few key variables can improve the session experience. Let's see how to do it!"
