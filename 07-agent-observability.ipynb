    "### What is Agent Observability?\n",
    "🚨 The challenge: Unlike traditional software that fails predictably, AI agents can fail mysteriously. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User: \"Find quantum computing papers\"\n",
    "- Agent: \"I cannot help with that request.\"\n",
    "- You: 😭 WHY?? Is it the prompt? Missing tools? API error?\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 The Solution: Agent observability gives you complete visibility into your agent's decision-making process. You'll see exactly what prompts are sent to the LLM, which tools are available, how the model responds, and where failures occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DEBUG Log: LLM Request shows \"Functions: []\" (no tools!)\n",
    "- You: 🎯 Aha! Missing google_search tool - easy fix!\n",

    "Foundational pillars of Agent Observability\n",
    "- Logs: A log is a record of a single event, telling you what happened at a specific moment.\n",
    "- Traces: A trace connects the logs into a single story, showing you why a final result occurred by revealing the entire sequence of steps.\n",
    "- Metrics: Metrics are the summary numbers (like averages and error rates) that tell you how well the agent is performing overall."
