    "ADK's callback system lets you hook into key execution moments. Callbacks are Python functions you define and attach to agents - ADK automatically calls them at specific stages, acting like checkpoints during the agent's execution flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle. When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.\n",

    "But here's the challenge: how does our callback function actually access the memory service and current session? That's where callback_context comes in.\n",
